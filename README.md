Keyboard is a plugin for [SpringRoll](http://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRoll). It is designed to make working with the keyboard outside of text editing easier. Keyboard has capabilities for detecting key presses and releases, tracking pressed keys, custom key binding, and complex key combinations (key combos coming soon).

##Installation

Keyboard can be installed using Bower.

```bash
bower install http://github.com/CloudKidStudio/Keyboard
```

##Examples

To test the examples, run the grunt task `examples`. This will download any dependencies and automatically launch the examples in your browser.

```bash
grunt examples
```

##Usage

Include keyboard.min.js in your libraries js or html, after SpringRoll's core.min.js.
After the Application is created, access the Keyboard instance with Application.instance.keyboard.
